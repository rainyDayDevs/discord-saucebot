info_title: âœ¨ Contribute to the SauceBot project on Patreon!
info_desc: SauceBot is a bot that allows you to search for the original source of artwork, doujins, anime and more on Discord.

    Did someone post an image you want the source of? Just right click the image, hover over apps, then select sauce. It's that easy!

    If you want the sauce of an image you have saved, just use the `/sauce file` or `/sauce url` commands.

    SauceBot was built using [SauceNAO](https://saucenao.com/), [Hikari](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari) and [python-anilist](https://github.com/AmanoTeam/python-anilist).
